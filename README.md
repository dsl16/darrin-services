# darrin-services
A monorepo for all my [Serverless](http://bit.ly/2L0hBXP) applications and services.
The rationale for a monorepo [can be found here](http://bit.ly/2x4pHqb).

## mangatracker
A system built on AWS infrastructure with Lambdas, DynamoDB, SQS, and SNS that scrapes TenManga for new updates to manga I want to track. The system should eventually integrate into a habit system as a reward - completion of a habit will unlock a chapter. Ideally, this could integrate with Habitica.
